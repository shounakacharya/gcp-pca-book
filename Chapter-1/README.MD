# Chapter 1

## 1. A quick tour for GCP Console

  * The Agenda of this GCP Lab is to Practice Logging into the GCP Console. Once Logged in, You can navigate  through the GCP Console to get yourself familiarized with the GCP Console. By the End of the Lab, you will understand how the GCP Console looks, Understand how you can serach various GCP services, and undersatnd various GCP resource locations and how they are categorized.   
  
  ### What is GCP Console?

   * User can create, configure and manage various cloud resources such as Virtual Machines (Google Compute Engine Instances), Storage Buckets (Google Cloud Storage), Databases (Google Cloud SQL, Cloud Firestore, etc) and more.

   * The console offers monitoring and logging tools that allow users to monitor the performance, health and utilization of their resources. it also provides access to logs and metrics to troubleshoot issues.

   * Users can deploy applications and services easily and scale resources up or down based on demand using features like Google Kubernetes Engine for container orchestration.

   * The GCP console provides tools to manage access control, setup firewalls, and implement security policies to ensure the protection of resources and data.

   * Users can track and manage their usage and costs, set budgets, and view billing information to optimize their spending on cloud services.

   ```

  10. Click on **AUTHORIZE**


   ![Alt text](./74.jpg)

  
   ![Alt text](./75.jpg)


  11. Now attach the disk with the instance. Replace <INSTANCE-NAME> with the name of the VM you created above i.e. **mount-instance**. 
  
   ```bash
   gcloud compute instances attach-disk <mount-instance> \ --disk data-disk \ --zone=us-central1-a 
   ```

   ![Alt text](./76.jpg)
   
  12. Click on the **SSH** button under the Connect section of your **mount-vm** virtual machine.  



   ![Alt text](./77.jpg)



   ![Alt text](./78.jpg)



  13. Enter the below command and press Enter.
 
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser -q
   ```
  
  14. You will receive below as the output. Copy the URL mentioned in the output.

   ![Alt text](./82.jpg)


  18. Enter the **Code** and click **Enter** You will receive below as the output.


   ![Alt text](./83.jpg)


  19. Use the below command to list the Disk available.

   ```bash
   sudo lsblk
   ```


  20. You will receive something like the below as the output. Here **sdb** is the disk you want to mount to the VM i.e the one you created above.


   ![Alt text](./84.jpg)



  21. Now, let's format the disk and make sure the disk is empty. We are using **mkfs** here which is a hard disk partitioning system for Linux. Here **-m** defines the reserved blocks percentage, **-F** forces mkfs to create a File system, **-E laz_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard** speeds up the filesystem initialization. **/dev/sdb** is the path to the Disk that we want to mount.

  ```bash
  sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -F -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard /dev/sdb
  ```

  22. You will receive the below as the output.  


   ![Alt text](./85.jpg)


  23. Now, let's create a **Mount directory** that will act as a Point to attach to the VM. Here the path is **/data-mount/test**.

  ```bash
  sudo mkdir -p /data-mount/test
  ```

  24. After Formatting and creating the directory, now mount the disk on the VM using the below command.

   ```bash
   sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/sdb /data-mount/test
   ```

  25. Run the below command to get the list of the disk.

   ```bash
   lsblk
   ```

  26. You will have the below as the output, have a look at the path of the Mountpoint, it looks different from the Mountpoint as in Step20.

   
![Alt text](./86.jpg)


  27. The Disk is mounted, but in order to make it functional, we need to assign it the read and write permissions.

   ```bash
   sudo chmod a+w /data-mount/test
   ```

  28. Confirm the mounting of PD to the VM using the below command.

   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

  29. You will see below as the output. Observe the **/dev/sdb** and its attributes such as **Used, Use%**.

   
   ![Alt text](./87.jpg)


  30. Go back to the Google Cloud Console and click on the Virtual Machine that you created i.e. **mount-vm**.


   ![Alt text](./88.jpg)


  31. Scroll down and you will observe that a data disk is added to the VM with the name **data-disk** with Mode as **R/W**.

   
   ![Alt text](./89.jpg)


  31. **Delete** the **Instance** and **Additional Data Disk** After completed the lab successfully.
       
      Click on **Action** button and select **Delete**.


   ![Alt text](./90.jpg)
